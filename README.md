# PiTrust Infrastructure Protocol

> **"Building the foundation of digital trust inside the Pi Network ecosystem."**

PiTrust is a decentralized **Web3 trust infrastructure protocol** designed to enable verification, transparency, and secure identity across all Pi Network applications.

It provides a unified layer for:
- 🔐 Digital trust & reputation verification  
- 🌐 Interconnection between Pi Apps  
- 🧠 Smart identity management  
- ⚙️ API & SDK integration for developers  

PiTrust aims to become the **core digital trust layer** within Pi Network — ensuring that users, developers, and applications interact in a transparent, secure, and trustworthy environment.
