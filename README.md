## 💡 Why PiTrust? Solving the Trust Problem

The Pi Network ecosystem requires a foundational layer of **verifiable trust** and **reputation**. PiTrust Protocol provides a decentralized infrastructure that allows users and dApps to instantly verify credentials, reputation scores, and professional histories without relying on centralized authorities.

### **Key Strategic Differentiators:**

1.  **Unmatched Economic Efficiency:** We utilize optimized smart contracts to ensure an industry-leading **95% reduction in transaction fees (Gas)** for credential verification. **Building trust should be affordable for everyone.**
2.  **True Pi Utility & Security:** The protocol is secured by our **Trust Validators Program**, which requires a **100 $\pi$ Staking** commitment, directly linking the protocol's security to the value of the Pi Coin.
3.  **DAO Governance:** Managed entirely by the community of $\pi$ stakers, ensuring a transparent, censorship-resistant, and decentralized future.
4.  ## 🛠️ Get Started: Integration is Simple

PiTrust is designed for seamless integration into any Pi Network dApp (E-commerce, Job Matching, DeFi). Stop building custom reputation systems and leverage our audited, Mainnet-Ready infrastructure.

### **PiTrust SDK/API (Example)**

You can integrate a verifiable trust score into your application in three simple steps:

1.  **Install:** `npm install @PiTrust/sdk`
2.  **Initialize:** `const trust_api = new PiTrustAPI('YOUR_API_KEY');`
3.  **Verify User:** `const score = trust_api.getUserReputation('Pioneer_ID');`
