## 💡 Why PiTrust? Solving the Trust Problem
The Pi Network ecosystem requires a foundational layer of **verifiable trust** and **reputation**.  
PiTrust Protocol provides a decentralized infrastructure that allows users and dApps to instantly verify credentials, reputation scores, and professional histories without relying on centralized authorities.

## 🔑 Key Strategic Differentiators
1. **Unmatched Economic Efficiency**  
   Optimized smart contracts ensure an industry-leading **95% reduction in transaction fees (Gas)** for credential verification.  
   *Building trust should be affordable for everyone.*

2. **True Pi Utility & Security**  
   Secured by the **Trust Validators Program**, requiring a **100 π staking** commitment, directly linking protocol security to the value of the Pi Coin.

3. **DAO Governance**  
   Managed entirely by the community of π stakers, ensuring transparency, censorship-resistance, and decentralization.
