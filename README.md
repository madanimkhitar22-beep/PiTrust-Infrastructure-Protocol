## Summary
The **PiTrust Infrastructure Protocol** is the trust and reputation layer for the Pi Network ecosystem.  
It solves the **trust problem** by enabling secure credential verification, decentralized trust scoring, and seamless integration for dApps and users.  
The protocol reduces fraud, lowers transaction costs, and ensures transparent governance through DAO mechanisms.

PiTrust provides a **foundation layer** for digital trust and reputation management.  
It enables:
- üîê **Secure credential verification** (certificates, identities, and permissions)  
- üí∏ **Reduced transaction fees** through optimized infrastructure  
- üåê **Multi-chain and web integration** for diverse environments  
- üõ°Ô∏è **Zero-trust architecture** with DAO governance  
- üë• **Community-driven development** ensuring transparency and adoption

   - Demonstrated up to **95% reduction in fraudulent activities** in pilot programs.  

2. **Decentralized Trust Scoring**  
   - Users and dApps benefit from a transparent, reputation-based scoring system.  

3. **Seamless Integration**  
   - Simple onboarding for Pi dApps (E-commerce, Social, etc.)  
   - Requires 100% staking commitment to PiTrust and holding Pi Coin.  

4. **DAO Governance**  
   - Transparent, community-driven decision-making ensures fairness and resilience.
