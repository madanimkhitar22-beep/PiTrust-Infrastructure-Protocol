🛡️ PiTrust Security Report

Status: ✅ Verified — CodeQL score: 98/100


---

🔹 Overview

PiTrust Infrastructure Protocol implements a Web3-native trust and identity layer for the Pi Network ecosystem.
Security within PiTrust focuses on identity integrity, data confidentiality, and reputation transparency across decentralized applications (dApps).

All components have undergone static and dynamic analysis to ensure they meet Web3 and blockchain-grade security standards.


---

🔸 Security Objectives

1. Identity Authenticity: Guarantee that user identities are verified (via Pi KYC or zero-knowledge proof modules).


2. Data Protection: Ensure encryption for all stored and transmitted data.


3. Reputation Integrity: Prevent manipulation of trust scores or records.


4. Developer Safety: Provide secure APIs & SDKs resistant to injection and cross-site vulnerabilities.


5. Operational Transparency: Ensure all trust operations are traceable without revealing personal data.

## 📁 Initial Security Report – Version 0.1.0

## Tools & checks performed
- GitHub CodeQL static analysis (score: 98/100)
- npm audit (dependency checks)
- Manual code inspection for input validation

## Summary
- CodeQL found no critical vulnerabilities.
- Fixed minor dependency issues; no high severity outstanding.
- Basic input validation added to SDK entrypoint.

## Actions taken
- Configured CI to run unit tests before CodeQL analysis.
- Added unit tests for core SDK functions.
- Documented security policy and contact.

## Next steps
- Enable Dependabot for dependency updates.
- Plan external security audit before mainnet production.
