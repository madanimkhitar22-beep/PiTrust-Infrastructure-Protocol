# PiTrust Whitepaper

## 1. Abstract
PiTrust is a decentralized trust and reputation protocol designed to serve as the **foundational trust layer for the Pi Network ecosystem**.  
It enables secure digital identity verification, transparent reputation scoring, and interoperable trust APIs for decentralized applications (dApps).  
The protocol aims to reduce fraud, improve user onboarding, and empower developers to build safer Web3 applications within Pi Network.

## 2. Vision & Objectives
**Vision:**  
To create a unified digital trust layer that connects all Pi Network users, apps, and services under a verifiable reputation system.

**Objectives:**
- Build a decentralized identity verification mechanism using cryptographic proofs.
- Implement a fair, tamper-resistant reputation model for users and developers.
- Provide an open, modular SDK for Pi developers to integrate trust data into their dApps.
- Ensure full transparency and governance through DAO participation.

## 3. Architecture Overview
PiTrust operates as a **multi-layered protocol** within the Pi Network ecosystem:

| Layer | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **Identity Layer** | Decentralized identity (DID) verification and credential issuance. |
| **Reputation Layer** | Scoring system that evaluates trustworthiness of identities and applications. |
| **Integration Layer** | Unified SDK/API allowing dApps to access verified trust data securely. |
| **Governance Layer** | DAO-driven mechanisms for protocol updates, validator roles, and reputation logic changes. |

---

## 4. Core Components
- **DID Engine:** Handles secure identity creation and validation using Pi credentials.  
- **Reputation Oracle:** Computes and stores trust scores based on user behavior, app interactions, and validator feedback.  
- **Trust API/SDK:** Provides a simple, developer-friendly interface to integrate trust data into apps.  
- **Audit Layer:** Logs transactions and updates for transparency and community review.

---

## 5. Security & Governance
PiTrust follows a **zero-trust architecture** and integrates with the Pi Network’s native security modules.

**Security principles:**
- All transactions are cryptographically signed and verifiable.  
- No central authority controls trust issuance — governance is community-driven.  
- CodeQL and static security checks are performed automatically for every build.

**Governance Model (DAO):**
- **Proposals:** Community and developers can suggest upgrades.  
- **Voting:** Reputation-weighted consensus.  
- **Transparency:** All governance actions logged on-chain.

---

## 6. Integration with Pi SDK
PiTrust provides direct integration with the official **Pi SDK** to support:
- **Authentication:** Validate user identity via Pi credentials.  
- **Payments:** Enable micro-transactions with verified trust levels.  
- **Reputation Sharing:** Allow apps to access and display verified trust scores.

SDK features:
- RESTful endpoints (`/trust/verify`, `/reputation/query`)  
- Client libraries for JavaScript and Python  
- Future roadmap: Rust + Go support for cross-chain apps

---

## 7. Roadmap
| Phase | Description | Status |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **Phase 1** | Core protocol + CodeQL security verification | ✅ Completed |
| **Phase 2** | Integration with Pi SDK (identity + payments) | 🔄 Q4 2025 |
| **Phase 3** | Launch of DAO governance and on-chain reputation | ⏳ Q1 2026 |
| **Phase 4** | Cross-chain interoperability & full mainnet launch | 🚀 Planned |

---

## 8. Conclusion
PiTrust establishes the foundation for **trust, transparency, and security** across the Pi ecosystem.  
By combining decentralized identity, fair reputation systems, and community-led governance, PiTrust empowers over 60 million pioneers to safely interact, trade, and innovate in the Web3 era.
