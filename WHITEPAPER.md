# PiTrust Protocol – Whitepaper (v2.0)

## 📘 Abstract

PiTrust is a **decentralized digital trust infrastructure** built for the Pi Network ecosystem.  
It forms the **core verification and governance layer** connecting identity, reputation, and interaction across Pi-powered applications.

PiTrust enables:
- Secure identity verification  
- Transparent reputation scoring  
- Trust-based access and collaboration  
- Seamless interoperability between Pi ecosystem services  

Now fully integrated with **PiQuantum Nexus**, PiTrust evolves from a single protocol to the **foundation of intelligent decentralized governance** within PiOS.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To establish a **unified trust layer** that allows over **60 million pioneers** to interact safely and confidently across the decentralized Web — from financial dApps to governance systems and AI-assisted decision layers.

PiTrust’s ultimate goal is to **replace centralized verification** with **community-verified digital integrity**.

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

### 🔹 Identity Signals
Integration with:
- Pi Network KYC verification  
- Behavioral and on-chain activity metrics  
- Pi SDK authentication & wallet signatures  

### 🔹 Reputation Engine
A transparent, decentralized scoring system:
- Tracks verified actions, trustworthiness, and contribution  
- Enables dynamic trust vectors and risk assessments  
- Directly interfaces with PiQuantum Nexus for intelligence-based moderation  

### 🔹 Trust Vector API
A lightweight SDK that allows developers to:
- Query trust scores and identity status  
- Embed PiTrust checks into their dApps  
- Enable trust-gated access or weighted governance  

### 🔹 Smart Contract Integration
PiTrust can be embedded into any Pi-based smart contract to:
- Enforce trust-based access control  
- Power decentralized arbitration and escrow systems (via Equilibrium)  
- Enhance transaction integrity and governance decisions

## 📣 Why PiTrust Matters

With millions of pioneers interacting daily, **trust is not optional — it’s the foundation.**

PiTrust creates a **decentralized identity and reputation backbone** that ensures:
- Safer transactions  
- Verified collaboration  
- Stronger governance  
- Foundation for AI-assisted trust decisions  

Through PiTrust, every app in the Pi ecosystem gains access to a **shared language of trust**.

---

## 🧠 Integration within the Ecosystem

PiTrust is now a **central node** in the PiOS ecosystem, directly interfacing with:

- **PiBridge:** Secure migration and interoperability  
- **PiStorage:** Decentralized, encrypted data layer  
- **PiNet OS:** Distributed governance and infrastructure management  
- **PiQuantum Nexus:** Quantum-intelligent orchestration layer  

This integration transforms PiTrust into a **living trust protocol** — adaptable, scalable, and intelligent.
